# The Application of Radiomic Features of Conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in The Early Diagnosis of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease with Machine Learning
In this study, a public dataset of Parkinson's disease patients (27) and healthy controls (16) was acquired, and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained. A radiomics pipeline was implemented to extract a comprehensive set of quantitative features from the MRI data, including shape, texture, and intensity-based features. These features captured subtle variations in the images related to Parkinson's disease pathology. Two classification models (SVM and ANN) were trained with the dataset. One instance involved the combined radiomics features with two separate feature selection methods employed. The feature importance sorting method was used for the SVM model while the SVM-RFE was used for the ANN model.
